    issue1: {
      question: "Where does ROSE collect the data about my social media sites' usage and my comments from?",
      answer: "<p>ROSE collects data from and stores data in your web browser. There is no automatic transmission of data between ROSE and the social media sites, or between ROSE and the researchers of the study. ROSE will provide a pre-assembled option through which you can send your data to the researchers.</p><p>There is a disadvantage as a result of this privacy-aware design of ROSE. Since data is stored locally with no automatic uploading, it can get lost in the case of system errors on your computer, or in the case of accidental deletion of ROSE from your web browser. Data is irretrievable once it is lost.</p>"
    },
    issue2: {
      question: "Are my ROSE study comments visible to other study participants or my social media site friends?",
      answer: "<p>No, the comments you make through ROSE are invisible to other study participants or your social media site friends. For technical reasons, ROSE does not transmit data to the server of the social media sites or to the researchers of the study. ROSE does not receive data from any other source either. Though ROSE is integrated in your web browser and the social media sites interface, thus appearing like “real” social media site functions, it completely and exclusively functions in your web browser. There is no way for the social media sites to detect whether or not you are using ROSE.</p>"
    },
    issue3: {
      question: "What types of data are recorded by ROSE?",
      answer: "<p>ROSE records the following types of data:</p><ul><li>Date and time of interactions on social media sites, i.e., the time the study participant engages in an interaction. </li><li>Type of interaction, e.g., “liking content,” “viewing a profile,” “sharing content.”</li><li>Unique identifiers, eight-digit combinations of letters and numbers (e.g., \"2a2d6fc3\") that correspond to each story item (e.g., a picture, a status update) the study participant interacted with. With the identifiers, researchers can detect when multiple study participants interact with the same story item. But the researchers will not know the content of the item.</li><li>Privacy settings concerning interactions, e.g. whether a story item is visible for “Friends” only or for the public.</li><li>Diary entries.</li><li>ROSE study comments.</li><li>Privacy settings in general.</li></ul>"
    },
    issue4: {
      question: "Does ROSE collect the actual content I share with my friends on social media sites?",
      answer: "<p>No. ROSE does not collect any content information, such as pictures, links, or messages on Timelines; chat messages; or the name of groups you attended. ROSE only collects data about the usage of a type of interaction, e.g., whether you commented on a picture, or whether you engaged in a chat with a  friend. In the analysis, researchers are only able to see whether you engaged in an interaction, the timestamp, and the type of interaction. For example, researchers can see that you commented on a picture, but they will not know whether the picture is about a polar bear or friends at a party. If you would like to report information regarding the content of an interaction in order to explain why you made use of a specific action, please use the ROSE comments function or the diary function.</p>"
    },
    issue5: {
      question: "How do I control what types of interaction ROSE collect?",
      answer: "<p>You can easily check the types of interaction recorded from the ROSE user interface (menu item “Interactions”). When you export and share your data with the researchers, you can also view all data collected in the compact text-based data format. You will see from the exported data file that there is no personal data collected.</p>"
    },
    issue6: {
      question: "How can I be sure that ROSE makes my data anonymous?",
      answer: "<p>ROSE data does not contain any information identifying the social media site user who created the data. ROSE does not save any social media site user names, pictures, or videos provided by users. Thus, ROSE data is similar to anonymized data collected through other means, such as anonymous interviews. </p>"
    },
    issue7: {
      question: "May I review the source code to check previous declarations?",
      answer: "<p>Yes. ROSE is free, open-source software under GPL-license (General Public License). You may review the source code, change, or process it under the conditions of the GPL. Should you need assistance, please contact the project advisor. </p>"
    },
    issue8: {
      question: "May I use ROSE for personal purposes after the study ends?",
      answer: "<p>Yes. You may continue using ROSE for your own records, as it does not send any information to the researchers automatically. Please note the GPL license’s conditions. However, after the completion of the study, we will not be able to provide any assistance, such as providing ROSE updates.</p>"

    salt: "Cryptographic salt for content identifiers",
    saltDesc: "ROSE records pseudonymous identifiers for user content that allow researchers to re-identify content without a need to reveal it. These identfiers are derived from user-entered content and a cryptographic salt. As a cryptographic salt you can enter any arbitray text string, for example \"ROSE123\" or whatever else you like. However, make sure that in case you investigate a group of participants all use the same salt in their ROSE configuration. Otherwise you can not correlate identifiers among participants afterwards.",
    hashLength: "Content identifier length",
    hashLengthDesc: "Here you can specify the length of the pseudonymous identifiers created by ROSE. You need to balance participants' privacy and the uniqueness of identifiers: the shorter the identifier the more secure they are; the longer the identifiers the more unique they are. Every digit adds a factor of 16 to the space of possible identifiers for your study. For example, setting the option to 4 allows for 16*16*16*16=65536 unique identifiers for your study. 5 is a good value if you are unsure how to use this option.",
